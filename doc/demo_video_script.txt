* Introduction
** Old Folks on Web3
*** Matt: TI/99, 1980 - TCP Dec 1995
*** Bob: TRS-80, 1980 - Cleveland Freenet 1992
*** 84 years combined programming experience
*** 57 years combined Internet experience
*** Worldwide network connectivity, connecting factories in South Korea, Mexico
*** Web1 Decentralization
*** New to Web3, whose cultural values resonate with this old Web1 hacker.
* Demo
** User Experience
** Limited scope, as we are new to Web3, Fluence, Rust, React, TypeScript
** You /can/ teach old dogs new tricks!
* Code Features
** Marine Rust service layer.
*** Curl and transform the two flavors of JSON doc into a common struct.
*** Having troubles accessing production OpenSea, that is stubbed out.
** Aqua process control layer.
*** Basic calls that can be orchestrated directly by JavaScript
*** Advanced call that invokes OpenSea and Rarible first pages in parallel.
*** Impressed with how easy service composition is in Aqua.
** JavaScript, TypeScript, React UX layer.
*** Simplified to demonstrate basic capability while learning as fast as we can.
* Lessons Learned
** First impressions can be deceiving, stay open to discovery.
*** I thought the magic was in the Rust and Javascript. We will be spending more time with Aqua, which seems very promising for the data engineering and data science workflows I would like to do.
** Even simple things are hard when you are new to almost everything in a platform.
** Web3 is a fascinating space, holding even more promise than my rather optimistic perspective a few weeks ago when we started looking at this hackathon.
* Summary
** This has been an exciting first foray into Web3. You will be seeing more of us!
